// Extended-address polling (0x18DADBF1 request / 0x18DAF1DB response) for
// individual cell voltages, balancing status, and a few lifetime metrics.
//
// This is a *separate* protocol from the standard KWP2000 UDS used above
// (0x79B/0x7BB) - the two do not interact. The 0x79B/0x7BB service has never
// answered a single request on this battery (confirmed across many CAN
// captures); this extended address is the one that actually works, confirmed
// three independent ways:
//   - the user's own OVMS RT32 vehicle module for this exact battery
//   - a captured real-vehicle OBD log during an AC charge session
//   - Battery-Emulator's own RENAULT-ZOE-GEN2-BATTERY.cpp driver (same LBC
//     protocol family, same PIDs)
//
// Comment out the line below to disable this extended polling entirely. With
// it disabled, cell_voltages_mV[]/cell_balancing_status[] stay unpopulated
// (as before) and the pack voltage estimate reverts to the original
// (min+max)/2*96 approximation further down in this file.

// Time frames towards the battery, both once per second while this driver transmits normally:
//   - 0x53B: the vehicle clock. Layout (derived from three real vehicle logs, byte 2 and the always-zero
//     bits are copied as seen there): byte 0 = hour << 3, byte 1 = minute << 2, byte 2 = 0x06,
//     byte 3 = year bits (7:6) + second, byte 4 = month << 4, byte 5 = day << 3 + weekday (Monday = 0).
//     The DATE is fixed (15.03.2025), only the time of day is real (NTP, local time incl. daylight
//     saving). Until NTP has delivered a time the clock runs on from 12:00:00.
//   - 0x350: the vehicle state, every 100 ms like in the vehicle. In normal operation state C7 (`C7 .. 14 98
//     94 45`, what the vehicle sends while it is ready to drive, taken from two real vehicle logs of
//     02./03.10.); the sleep sequence and the wake burst replace it while they run. Bytes 1-3 are a 24-bit
//     "vehicle age" in minutes since 15.02.2021 and are computed from the real time (see vehicle_age_minutes()
//     below), also in the sleep/wake sequences.
